files in /workletnodes are generated by faust2wasm
so are the files in ./public/static/wasm (and ./build/static/wasm)

./src/sound-generation/faust/modified-arch-files/ has the templates used by the faust2wasm script, i changed them a bit to compile.

faustModuleNames.ts is generated by ./scripts/compile-faust-programs.sh, which also moves files around to the right place
